# Joke of the Commit

Automatically appends a joke to every Git commit message because debugging is better with a little humor.

## Features

- Appends a random joke from JokeAPI to your Git commit messages.
- Supports custom joke categories, blacklist flags, and language via a simple config file.
- Lightweight, no Git aliases or wrapper scripts needed.

## Installation

### Local (In each repo)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harryfoster1812/Joke-of-the-Commit.git
cd Joke-of-the-Commit
./install.sh
```

This will install the commit-msg hook into your local Git repository.

### Globally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harryfoster1812/Joke-of-the-Commit.git
cd Joke-of-the-Commit
./install-global-template.sh
```

This is will add the commit-msg hook to the git template folder. This will make it so that when using `git init` the hook will be automatically installed into the repo

>![Note]
> This will not effect existing repos only ones initialised using `git init`

## Config

You can customize the joke settings by creating a .jokehookrc file in the home directory
example:

```ini
category=Programming
blacklist=nsfw,religious
lang=en
```

These are the only three options currently supported, to see the values that can be passed please see the [JokeAPI Documentation](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/)

# Notes

- The hook modifies the commit message before the commit is finalised, it wonâ€™t affect your code or history.
- The hook only runs locally and must be installed per repository (unless added via a template or global config).

# Uninstall

```bash
rm .git/hooks/commit-msg
```
